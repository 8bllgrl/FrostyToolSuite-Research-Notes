# ðŸ“– Frosty Tool Suite Research

open-source research notes and code mapping project for the **Frosty Tool Suite** 

This documentation is for a higher-level overview of the codebase to make it easier for modders and developers to find relevant code and contribute. AI is used for the summaries section to make the process smoother, but it is highly reccommended to be reviewed by a human to ensure consistency.

Ghidra scripts may later be included.

## ðŸ§­ 

* **[AI Generated Summaries](/FrostyToolSuite-Research-Notes/ai-summaries/example)**: automatically generated documentation for namespaces and folders.

## Goal
providing clear maps of the Frosty Tool Suite.
