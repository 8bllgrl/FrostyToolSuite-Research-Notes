This research project is dedicated to reverse-engineering and reconstructing code from proprietary binary distributions of the Frosty Toolsuite. This effort is undertaken to defend the foundational principles of the GNU General Public License (GPL) and ensure that all derivative works remain free and open for the community.

[The GPL](https://github.com/FrostyToolsuite/FrostyToolsuite?tab=GPL-3.0-1-ov-file) 

The core mission of this project is to exercise the freedoms guaranteed to every recipient of GPL-licensed software. We assert our right to inspect and modify the software based on the following:

> Preamble's Intent: The GNU General Public License "is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free software for all its users".
>  Freedom to Receive Source: The licenses "are designed to make sure that you... receive source code or can get it if you want it".
> The Right to Modify: The licenses ensure that "you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things".


The proprietary distributors of the updated Frosty Toolsuite binaries are in direct violation of the GPL-3.0's most critical requirement: the obligation to provide corresponding source code.

> The Distributor's Obligation (Preamble): The distributor must "make sure that they [recipients], too, receive or can get the source code".

> The Violation (Section 6): Distributors who conveyed these non-source forms (binaries/DLLs) violated Section 6 (Conveying Non-Source Forms), which strictly requires: "You may convey a covered work in object code form... provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License".

> The Scope: This violation is critical because "The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs".


In other words, 

The goal of this project is to restore code rights to the open-source modding community by reconstructing features withheld behind proprietary paywalls. This work is conducted on the express condition that the resulting code is used solely for single-player modifications, explicitly prohibiting its use to gain any unfair advantage in multiplayer environments.
