[The GPL](https://github.com/FrostyToolsuite/FrostyToolsuite?tab=GPL-3.0-1-ov-file) is intended  to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program and to make sure it remains free software for all its users."

Section 2 states you have the right "to study how the Program works, and change it."

Distributors which redistribute FrostyToolsuite under proprietary or paid versions, violated Section 6 of the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE by distributing compiled, derivative binaries without providing the Corresponding Source. 

Since the source was not provided, reverse engineering and reconstruction are the only means available to the community to restore compliance.

In other words, this is intended to spearhead bringing mod development code to the community, granted all changes are for single-player games and not to gain an advantage over other users in multiplayer.
